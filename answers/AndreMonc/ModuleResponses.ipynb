    "# The matplotlib library was developed by John D. Hunter, and can be imported into Python \n",
    "# for the purpose of creating various charts and graphs such as line plots, histograms, \n",
    "# scatter plots, 3D plots, and much more. It is designed to produce professional level \n",
    "# figures, and is thus of great use to those who want to visually represent their data. \n",
    "# There is a much flexibility built into this library, so that you can produce a highly \n",
