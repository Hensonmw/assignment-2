    "`If we use import numpy, all sub-modules and functions in the numpy module can only be accesses in the numpy.namespace. For example numpy.array([1,2,3]) If we use from numpy import , all functions will be loaded into the local namespace. For examplearray([1,2,3]). From numpy import import NumPy directly into the current namespace so that we don't have to use dot notation at all, but rather simply call the functions as if they were built in,however, this strategy is usually frowned upon in Python programming because it starts to remove some of the nice organization that modules provide. If a module contains more than one function, using from numpy import will give you direct access to all of them.However if you use from numpy import random, we'll only have access to that specific function, and no others.`\n",

If you use import random, we have access to all of the functions, but you must prefix them with the module name, e.g. random.uniform(a,b) because you imported the module itself, not the functions specifically, into your 'namespace'. From numpy import random we have access to random from numpy and we can just type random to recall it.`\n",

Its core packages ( Python, ipython, numpy, scipylibrary, matplotlib, pandas, symy, nose) includes modules for graphics and plotting, optimization, integration, special functions, signal and image processing, genetic algorithms, ODE solvers, and others. \n",
    "There are  several  useful functions in Scipy module. Because Scipy builds on Numpy, so we can use all Numpy functions such as array creation, array  types and conversion ,â€¦ Some SciPy basic functions are polynomials, vectorizing function, type handling. \n",
    "There is a useful sub- package in Scipy which specifically can help to solve many problems in biology that needs statistics. It is Scipy.stats package.  Over 80 continuous random variables (RVs) and 10 discrete random variables  are located in the sub-package scipy.stats. We can use the t-test in Scipy module  to test whether the mean of our sample differs in a statistcally significant way from the theoretical expectation. As an example:  \n",

    "Another SciPy sub-package is Multidimensional image processing (scipy.ndimage) .Image processing and analysis are generally seen as operations on two-dimensional arrays of values. But for  biological imaging images of higher dimensionality must be analyzed .The scipy.ndimage packages provides a number of general image processing and analysis functions that are designed to operate with arrays of arbitrary dimensionality. The packages currently includes functions for linear and non-linear filtering, binary morphology, B-spline interpolation, and object measurements.\n",
