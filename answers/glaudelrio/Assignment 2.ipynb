    "1. How are these different from each other? Be specific.\n",
    "First, 'import numpy' besides importing this module, creates a reference to that module, so I can write numpy.name to refer to things or functions defined in this module. Second, 'from numpy import *' will import numpy and also creates reference in the namespace to all public objects defined in the module. Then, you can use just a plain name to refer to things defined in the module. You don't need to use numpy.name. Finally, 'from numpy import random' imports the module and creates a reference to 'random', so you can use this object in your program. In this last case, you also don't need to use numpy.random.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which of the above do you think is preferred? Why?\n",
    "I think using just 'import numpy' is prefered, since this will contribute to code clarity. For instance, if you use 'from numpy import random', you will be able to use 'random' allover your code, and this could make complicated to understand from where this object is comming. On the other hand, if you use 'import numpy', this means that everytime you call 'random', you will express that this is inside the 'numpy'module '(numpy.random)'. Furthermore, if you are going to use other functions in the same module, you don't need to import things again. Ultimatelly there is a potential problem of overwriting functions as I am going to explain in the next item.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What happens to the stdlib module random if you run from numpy import random? Provide an example.\n",
    "It seems to me that as soon as I start using 'random' after this, I will be able to use only numpy 'random' and not stdlib 'random'. As you can see in the screenshot number 3 (RedefiningRandom-ImportTask3), as soon as I use 'from numpy import random', the random module is redefined and after that I am not able to get back to the 'stdlib random'. This could be avoided by importing 'numpy', and using 'numpy.random' always. I show the difference between both 'randoms' below.\n",
