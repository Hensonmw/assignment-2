    "Within the standard library, one useful module is 'textwrap.' This module allows you to keep multiple lines of plain text (or a paragraph) to a maximum user-set value of characters (width). This can come in handy when dealing with long strings of code (something we'll get to in the near future) that would otherwise be tricky to interpret visually, especially if there are window viewing size constraints. Textwrap includes many functions, however, some of the easier ones (at least to me) include the functions width() and fill(). If you happen to make a string of code that exceeds the width of Python's window, said to be 80 characters, you can wrap the text and constrain it to the window size or character length of your choosing. You can do this with the function fill() by importing textwrap and then assigning the string of code to a variable of your choosing (below it is \"assignmenttext\"). Next, you will use the print() function to print the output of the textwrap.fill() function where you include the name of the varialbe (assignmenttext), a comma, and the width parameter you want to set (SEE BELOW). For my example I took the directions for the Module portion of the assignment and wrapped the sting of text so it would be no more than 80 characters per line. \n"
